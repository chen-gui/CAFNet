## Description

This repository provides the implementation of CAFNet, a robust unsupervised deep learning framework for denoising distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data without requiring clean labels. CAFNet is a two-stage cascaded network consisting of a coarse module followed by a refined module. Each stage is built with fully connected layers, KAN network-based learnable activation functions, and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture coherent seismic signals.

## Scientific Application

CAFNet is designed for scientific workflows involving distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), where high‐resolution seismic information is often obscured by strong random and coherent noise. The proposed unsupervised framework enables researchers to denoise large‐scale DAS recordings without the need for curated clean datasets, making it particularly suitable for real-world observational studies.

By enhancing signal clarity and preserving coherent seismic phases, CAFNet facilitates multiple downstream scientific tasks, including:
* Earthquake detection and arrival picking
* Microseismic monitoring in carbon storage, geothermal, and oil & gas applications
* Ambient noise analysis and interferometry
* Distributed strain-rate and ground motion characterization
* Time-lapse subsurface imaging using DAS

## Examples
    The "Demos" directory contains all runable scripts to demonstrate DAS denoising applications of CAFNet. 
# Synthetic Example
The following is a synthetic denoising example. Denoising results for the synthetic DAS data using (a) BPF + MF, (b) FXDecon, (c) MSSA, (d) two-stage NN, and (e) the proposed method. For each method, the left and right panels show the denoised data and removed noise, respectively.

# FORGE example
The following is a FORGE DAS example. Denoising results for (a) the second FORGE DAS data using (b) BPF + MF, (c) FXDecon, (d) MSSA, (e) two-stage NN, and (f) the proposed method. Each panel shows, from left to right, the denoised data and removed noise.
