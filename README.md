## Description

This repository provides the implementation of CAFNet, a robust unsupervised deep learning framework for denoising distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data without requiring clean labels. CAFNet is a two-stage cascaded network consisting of a coarse module followed by a refined module. Each stage is built with fully connected layers, KAN network-based learnable activation functions, and attention mechanisms to adaptively capture coherent seismic signals.

## Scientific Application

CAFNet is designed for scientific workflows involving distributed acoustic sensing (DAS), where high‐resolution seismic information is often obscured by strong random and coherent noise. The proposed unsupervised framework enables researchers to denoise large‐scale DAS recordings without the need for curated clean datasets, making it particularly suitable for real-world observational studies.

By enhancing signal clarity and preserving coherent seismic phases, CAFNet facilitates multiple downstream scientific tasks, including:
* Earthquake detection and arrival picking
* Microseismic monitoring in carbon storage, geothermal, and oil & gas applications
* Ambient noise analysis and interferometry
* Distributed strain-rate and ground motion characterization
* Time-lapse subsurface imaging using DAS

## Examples
    The "Demos" directory contains all runable scripts to demonstrate DAS denoising applications of CAFNet. 
# Receiver Function Example
The following is a 2D denoising example on receiver function data. (a) Original data corrupted by both random and erratic noise. (b)--(d) Denoised data from CSDL after 250, 500, and 750 epochs, respectively. (e) Removed noise after 750 epochs. The black ellipse highlights the gradual recovery of data details through CSDL iterations.

# 3D Real Seismic data
The following is a 3D denoising example on post-stack data. Each 3D cube has been reshaped into a 2D matrix. (a) Original data contaminated by both random and erratic noise. (b) Denoised data corresponding to the PATCHUNET method. (c) Denoised data corresponding to CSDL. (d) Removed noise from PATCHUNET. (e) Removed noise from CSDL. (f) Local similarity data (calculated between the removed noise and denoised data) from PATCHUNET. (g) Local similarity data from CSDL. The similarity is calculated using the pyortho package (https://github.com/aaspip/pyortho).
